Problem:
Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k. 
If such a subset cannot be made, then return null. <br/>

Integers can appear more than one in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.

For example, give S = [12,1,61,5,9,2] and k = 24, return [12, 9,2,1] since it sums up to 24.
